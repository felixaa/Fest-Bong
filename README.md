Fest-Bong
=========
####Still under development!!!!!

Description
--
As a project in the IS-206 course at UiA, Kristiansand Norway. We are making both a client, and a scanner application where you can buy "bonger" or tickets to any major festival in Norway (atleast thats the thought).

It will be based on a client app, where you can choose festival and buy drink-tickets, and a scanner app where you can scan these tickets and check if they are valid.

As a backend we're using a REST-Api based on PHP and MySql - Using Slimframework, a framework for easy managing REST-api's

>* The scanner-application is based on scanning QR-Codes using the https://github.com/zxing/zxing - library.
>* The REST-api is based on [SLIM-framework].
