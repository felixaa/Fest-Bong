Fest-Bong
As a project in the IS-206 course at UiA, Kristiansand Norway. We are making a client application where you can buy "bonger" or tickets to any major festival in Norway (atleast thats the thought).

It will be based on a client app, where you can choose festival and buy drink-tickets, and a root app where you can scan these tickets and check if they are valid.

The application is based on scanning QR-Codes using the https://github.com/zxing/zxing - library.
